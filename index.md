I have been building websites for over 7 years. My goal is to bring small businesses an affordable and functional website/design that best serves their needs. Websites are very cost efficient but it can be daunting to do yourself. I can build a modern and functional website that only requires a one time design fee. The hosting required to keep a website on the internet is usually under $120 dollars a year depending on the sites needs. I only build "responsive" websites that scale to any screen including phones. I build sites lightweight so load times are fast and can include any number of features such as contact forms and embedded video. Please check out my portfolio [here](/portfolio). You can also [contact](/contact) me with any questions you may have.
