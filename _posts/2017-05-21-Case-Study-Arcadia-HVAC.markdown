The chosen logo below was created for an Atalanta based Heating & Cooling Company. They requested a modern approach but wanted something with a more retro feel. After a few rounds of designs they chose and loved the new mark. MDC also built a website for Arcadia. You can see the original site mockup below, as well as the final product [here](http://www.arcadiahvac.com).
