The below logo was created for a local Turkey Conservation club. They wanted a mark that represented their history and cause. They are also affiliated with the NWTF and did not want to clash with the NWTF logo. Wild Turkey conservation groups are responsible for the resurgence in turkey populations all over the united states. See all of the declined logos below as well as some sketches.
